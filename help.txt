To start using this system we first need to run the interpreter from problem set 3 using (init). Helper procedures such as: create-vector and create-matrix can be used to define vectors and matrices. They take a list of numbers or a list of list of numbers as the input respectively. Algebraic operators and other procedures such as determinant, row-reduce! and so on can be used in this environment to manipulate vectors and matrices. In order to press the system and interact for the steps used in the computation, we can use (show-steps). We can also probe a specific branch, of computation using (show-steps n) where n is a 1-indexed number that represents the specific branch that we want to explore. We can always go back one step higher in the computation using (backup). Another set of unadvised linear algebra operations are also defined in linalg.scm. For a concrete example of use cases please refer to the appendix of the report.
